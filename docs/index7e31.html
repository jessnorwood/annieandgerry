				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was Annie’s birthday early in May and as a surprise for her we had a day at Farleigh Hungerford Castle (English Heritage) where, lo and behold, James, Hannah, Lucy, Jonathon and Jess were also visiting with their children.  Grandchildren (and adults) had a super time exploring the castle ruins and having a picnic.  Annie thoroughly enjoyed her day out!<br />
<img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/586-20210508.jpg" width="586" height="439" /><br />
A couple of days later we visited Badbury Clump near Faringdon and enjoyed a gentle stroll through the woods admiring the bluebells.<br />
<img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/586-20210511a.jpg" width="586" height="439" /><br />
Turning through 180 degrees, <img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210511b.jpg" width="270" height="202" /><br />we were greeted by a yellow field of Rape.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
A day later we spent a very pleasant hour or so walking around the walled gardens and then the grounds of Buscot Park (National Trust).  The weather was iffy but it didn’t rain!<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>We ended the week by visiting Westonbirt Arboretum.  We had to have pre-booked tickets with a twenty minute arrival slot.  The arboretum opened at 9am and our slot started at 10am.  We were surprised to find that the car park was already incredibly busy.  On the first part of the walk we encountered a large number of dogs although they all seemed well controlled by their owners. The second part of the walk, through the “old arboretum” was a lot more pleasant as dogs were not allowed.  The rhododendrons were over their best but still provided a colourful backdrop.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Kingdom<img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210401a.jpg" width="270" height="360" /><br /> began to emerge from Lockdown 3 on 29 March.  We were blessed with some lovely weather as we were able to comply with the rule of 6 in gardens.<br />
.</p>
<p>We have already been able to see our UK based children and families apart from Martin and Louise.  For some the weather was kind for others there was a flurry of snow but at least it was predominately dry for our walks together and coffee etc in the garden<br />
.</p>
<p>We continued with our daily walking and observed the horse chestnut trees bursting forth.  It was quite something to watch the changes over just a few days after the first easing of lockdown.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/586-20210401b.jpg" width="586" height="439" /></p>
<p>On 12 April, with the next stage of lockdown easing, we were able to visit ‘non essential’ shops and enjoy food and drink at outdoor venues and the only immediate benefit for us was to be able to go swimming again which we did at 7am.<br />
We actually hesitated about going as we awoke to snow!  However, it was not much, and it had melted on contact with the road surface.  It was lovely to get back into a (warm) swimming pool.  After swimming we went for our daily walk from Eastleach to Southrop and return via Fyfield.   Below are some of the scenes we encountered:<br />
<img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210412a.jpg" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210412b.jpg" width="270" height="202" /><br />
<img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210412c.jpg" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210412e.jpg" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210412d.jpg" width="270" height="202" /><br />The next day was totally different with the sun shining, although not very warm, the same snow covered plants looked so much brighter.</p>
<p>We were able to sit in the garden (in our &#8216;bus shelter&#8217;) during the afternoon and although there is some colour in the garden we look forward to planting the summer plants in the next few weeks.  In the evening neighbours joined us for a glass of wine and we only packed up when it got quite cold at about 8pm!</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210413a.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/2021/270-20210413b.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>On our walk that day we both learned something that surprised us.  We came across a chicken beside the road pecking at a dead mole.  We had not realised that such carnivorous behaviour was normal.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early in February we enjoyed a wet and windy few days based at Hotel L&#8217;Hermitage in Montreuil Sur Mer.  Prior to crossing to France we stayed the night at the Premier Inn on the A20 just outside Dover. Thus, we had an early ferry and got to Montreuil just after lunch. After settling in to our splendid hotel room we made our customary circuit of the ramparts before enjoying a glass of wine or two. The next four days were typically spent walking in the morning, lunch and then a circuit of the ramparts before supper. We enjoyed lunches at L&#8217;Ecurie in Hesdin and L&#8217;Esplanade at Berck Plage where we had eaten on previous trips. However, we also found two new restaurants; Le Patio in Montreuil itself and Auberge du Cronquelet in the nearby village of St Aubin. Both of these restaurants proved to be excellent with gourmet food beautifully presented,good service and reasonable process. We shall certainly return!</p>
<p>The weather for our walks varied between needing full wet weather gear and just waterproof tops.  Not only did we have to contend with the rain, but the wind was often very gusty and bitingly cold. However, we had the right equipment and thoroughly enjoyed our walks. The views were often limited by the weather and greyness prevailed.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-20190209a.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-20190209b.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>. <img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-20190209c.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Our walks around the walls of the town were as pleasant as usual.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-20190209e.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-20190209d.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>One area of the town was undergoing major redevelopment but we could not determine whether the charm of the old town will be retained or replaced with modern uninspiring buildings. It would be a shame if the character and history of Montreuil were to be destroyed. That said, there was an outstanding piece of renovation on the spire of the church attached to our hotel – we were truly impressed.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/574-20190209f1.JPG" width="574" height="765" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again we had a really enjoyable break in what is certainly one of our favourite towns.</p>

<p>What an interesting month January has been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Cornwall, we have seen Daffodils, Camelias and snowdrops(but none in the photos).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-201901b.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-201901a.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a walk with Hannah, Rosie and Ptolemy at Stourhead we saw snowdrops and aconites,</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-201901c.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/270-201901d.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the month, we came upon daffodils and hyacinths during a walk at Blenheim Palace.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/2019inserts/584-201901f.JPG" width="584" height="438" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the first of February brought 12cm of snow to Fairford.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After quite a busy December and Christmas period, we decided to head to Mousehole,Cornwall for a week in a bungalow. Our fist night coincided with the last night of the famous Mousehole Christmas Lights.  Not knowing what to expect, we were delighted with the quality and extent of the lights around and in the harbour.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105a.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105b.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105c.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105d.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>Throughout<img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105l.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /> our week we enjoyed really good weather with temperatures  so much warmer than we would expect. We came across quite a few wild daffodils, Camellia and other flowers and bushes.  It was hard to imagine it was the second week of January.  As a result of the good weather, we managed to walk every day including National Trust sites at Penrose, Godolphin and Trelissick.  Additionally, we walked on the Cornish Coast Path at The Lizard and St Ives. Views from The lizard and of St Ives across the beach are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105m.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105e.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>Whilst we were in St Ives, we took the opportunity to visit the Tate Gallery.</p>
<p>We <img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105f.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br />also visited and were quite disappointed with Land End a profit making and tacky sort of place as far as we are concerned.</p>
<p>However, we then visited the Minack Theatre which was, by contrast, spectacular.  Not only was the theatre itself great to look at so were the views from various parts of the theatre. including the rocks going down to the sea from the back of the stage! and Porthcurno Beach</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/584-20190105g.JPG" width="584" height="438" /></p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/584-20190105h.JPG" width="584" height="438" /></p>
<p><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105i.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br /><img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105j.JPG" width="270" height="202" /></p>
<p>We also visited Mevagissey. <img src="/gallery/imgcache/albums/000inserts/0000inserts/270-20190105n.JPG" width="270" height="202" /><br />It was quite a drive from Mousehole but walking along the breakwater and  eating a pasty sitting on a seat overlooking the harbour is something we seem to do every time we visit Cornwall!</p>
<p>With the weather so good it was not surprising that we had some lovely sunrises and sunsets. This view is sunrise from the deck of our bungalow and is a fitting end to this blog entry.</p>

<p>James, Hannah, Rosy, Ptolemy, Lucy, (Dr) James and Emma all came to stay. We had glorious weather and were able to spend a lot of time in the garden with the paddling pool for the children.</p>
<p>We also walked to the park early on Sunday morning &#8211; Rosy enjoyed pushing Emma in the pushchair.</p>
<p>The planes were fantastic and below are just a few photos taken from The Nook.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We hope everyone had a very Happy Christmas.  We should have been visiting Jenny, Mark and the children for Christmas lunch but unfortunately even the best laid plans can hit problems.  Ours was Christmas Eve when Gerry felt unwell and had a temperature.  Annie rang the Chemotherapy Help Line (as per the instructions given to Gerry) and was told that we should go to the hospital.  Gerry was admitted and stayed until Christmas Day afternoon. Whatever the problem, the medics got it under control quickly and he left with even more tablets to take.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the staff at The Great Western Hospital Swindon for their care and kindness (and the visit from Santa and the turkey lunch).</p>
<p>PS If you are ever unfortunate enough to be admitted to the hospital do not despair the food is brilliant especially the soups!</p>
